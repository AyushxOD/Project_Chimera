# ðŸ¤– Project Chimera: A Predictive M&A Model

This project introduces a data-driven model to identify and rank high-potential M&A (Mergers & Acquisitions) targets in the semiconductor and AI chip industry.

---

### Key Question
Can we move beyond traditional financial metrics to predict the strategic success of a tech acquisition by quantifying factors like innovation, team quality, and market momentum?

---

### Methodology
The project followed a four-step data science workflow:

**1. Data Collection** -> **2. Exploratory Analysis (EDA)** -> **3. Feature Engineering** -> **4. Predictive Modeling**

---

### Key Insight: The Innovation vs. Hype Matrix
Analysis revealed that startups can be segmented into four key categories. The model's goal is to find the "Hidden Gems"â€”companies with strong technology but less market hype, representing undervalued opportunities.



---

### Top Recommendation
The model's #1 recommendation is for **Intel to acquire Ayar Labs**, with a projected **Synergy & Success Score of 91/100**. The acquisition would provide Intel with a foundational, defensible technology in optical I/O to lead the next generation of high-performance computing.
